**[Jacksum](http://www.jonelo.de/java/jacksum/index.html)** is a free and platform independent utility for computing and verifying checksums, CRCs and message digests as well as timestamps of files. 

Jacksum is entirely written in _Java_. 

It supports most common checksum algorithms (_Adler32, BSD sum, POSIX cksum, CRC-16, CRC-32, MD2, MD4, MD5, RIPEMD-128, RIPEMD-160, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, Unix System V sum, sum8, sum16, sum24, sum32, Whirlpool and xor8_)
