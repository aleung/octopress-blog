ClearCaseWeb is a simple web-based utility for browsing files stored in ClearCase. With it you can get the list of recent changed files and find out who is the last modifier of each line in a file in a very handy maner. The original idea to develop ClearCaseWeb is to overcome the lack of GUI for cleartool annotation. It's inspired by [CVSWeb](http://www.freebsd.org/projects/cvsweb.html), which is widely used in open source community.

ClearCaseWeb is developed in php. Currently it only works on Windows with ClearCase dynamic view successfully configurated.
