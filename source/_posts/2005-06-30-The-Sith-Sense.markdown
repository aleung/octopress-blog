It is a time of intergalactic uncertainty. Darth Vader's power continues to grow. He is now honing his abilities on anyone and everyone.

If you think of an object, he will ask you questions, read your thoughts and tell you what you were thinking of. All within twenty questions.

另外一个网站y.20q.net从问题和回答方面做得更好些，但是界面就不如 The Sith Sense cool了。帝国进行曲音乐之中伴随着vader的沉重呼吸声音，一切都像电影中那样。
