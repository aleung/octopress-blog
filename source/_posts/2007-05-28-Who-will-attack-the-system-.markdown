在一份关于某产品的安全考虑的presentation中看到这么一段话：

Who will attack the system?

  * Script Kiddies  
Focus on DoS and simple attacks ("just for fun") 
  * Sophisticated/Dedicated outside attacker  
Well educated and spend much time in learning the system. Economical motives. DoS, Fraud etc. 
  * Internal Attacker  
Knowledge about how the system is built. Dishonest or dissatisfied employees 
  * Competitors and **Governments**  
Possible to get good knowledge of the system. Large funding. Main motive to get over secret info.
